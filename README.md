I used to be really good at developing iOS apps, but then I realized that I'm more interested in product design (especially after getting more involved with design).

I currently live in Beijing, China, where I work as a product lead at TAIHUONIAO. When I'm not working, I like to take pictures and play with my Switch and PS4.
