### Hey There, I'm Fynn 👋
*based in Beijing, China.*


### Just a Product Manager. 🔭
*Working at [TAIHUONIAO](www.taihuoniao.com)*

### And previously did iOS development. 🌱
*Also wrote a project in Python to generate design posters. 🤔*

---
I used to be really good at developing iOS apps, but then I realized that I'm more interested in product design (especially after getting more involved with design).

I currently live in Beijing, China, where I work as a product lead at TaiHuoNiao. When I'm not working, I like to take pictures and play with my Switch and PS4.
